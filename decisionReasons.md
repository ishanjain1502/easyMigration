# Why I took the decisions I took????

### For loggin was going to impliment a watch on DB, to  record all transactions, but then rejected the idea.
> Reason was simple, I am expecting users to have an active service, in that case, if I record all transaction then my migration related transactions will get lost in between total transactions, then rollback purpose will be lost
